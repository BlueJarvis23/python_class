    "## Expected Understanding\n",
    "At this point in the class it is very important that you have a good understanding of the topics in Lecture_1 and Lecture_2. The topics today will build directly on the previous topics such as:\n",
    "    - Basic Data Types\n",
    "    - Conditionals\n",
    "    - Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "This week we will begin to talk about Functions. Functions are a way to compartmentalize code that performs a single job/function. Functions are one of the most useful concepts that we will cover in this class. We will spend this entire lecture examining functions and the application of functions in our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we talk about functions we will be required to have a discussion about _Scope_. Scope is an important topic because it determines where/which variables are accessible to our code. Understanding the rules of _Scope_ will help us avoid errors and trouble-shoot problems with our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indentation and Syntax will be increasingly important this week and therefore I will leave the sections about `Style` and `Syntax` in this lecture for easy reference."

    "Not everyone has a dedicated Windows machine that they can remote into, and not everyone has their own Linux account. Therefore we are going to use an online Python Interpreter to run our Python code for this class. This way we can practice in the lab and students can practice at home without having to install python on their PC. I will run python from my machine during the lecture so that the process of running python from the command line is understood.\n",

    "    - Indentation\n",

    "Syntax in the context of computer code is the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be a correctly structured document or fragment in that language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was designed to have a very clean look to the code. The compromise is that to correctly interpret the code python elected to use white space as a syntactical character. The last language to use syntactical white space was Fortran which was created by IBM in 1957.\n",
    "\n",
    "Languages such as Perl and C ignore white space and rely on other special characters that often mean different things in different contexts. This allowed the programmer to develop their own style independent of the format of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick example is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "foreach my $a (@list_of_numbers){\n",
    "    print \"value of a: $a\\n\";\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact same Perl code could be written like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "foreach my $a (@list_of_numbers){ print \"value of a: $a\\n\"; }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because one of the characters that Perl uses to group instructions are \"{}\" (brackets).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python avoids this type of problem by requiring white space syntax to group sequences of instruction:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for a in list_of_numbers:\n",
    "    print( \"Value of a: \" + str(a))\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Functions\n",
    "A function is a named section of the program that performs a specific task. In general, functions take inputs then perform actions on them and return a new value to the part of the program that called the function. Functions allow us to write code in a way that can be written one time and execute it whenever we want using the inputs we desire. This allows us to write less code. We could use the same code with different inputs to generate different outputs."

The `2`, `3`, `4` and the `9`, `2`, `4` in the lines where we call the function are all called _arguments_. This is only a slight distinction but if we keep this nomenclature it will make explaining functions quite a bit easier. The _return value_ of the function is what the function gives back to us.

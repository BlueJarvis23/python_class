    "At this point in the class it is very important that you have a good understanding of the topics in Lecture_1. The topics today will build directly on the Basic Data Types. \n",
    "    - Int/Float\n",
    "    - Bool\n",
    "    - String\n",
    "    - List/Tuple\n",
    "    - Dictionary\n",
    "Today's topics will allow our code to execute in a way that is not directly linear. We will cover Conditionals and Looping. Conditionals will allow us to make decisions in our code and only execute specific parts. Loops will give us a quick way to execute multiple instructions over and over without having to directly write out every instruction.\n",

Therefore we are going to use an online Python Interpreter to run our Python code for this class. This way we can practice in the lab and students can practice at home without having to install python on their PC. I will run python from my machine during the lecture so that the process of running python from the command line is understood.\n",

    "### Syntax\n",
    "Syntax in the context of computer code is the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be a correctly structured document or fragment in that language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was designed to have a very clean look to the code. The compromise is that to correctly interpret the code python elected to use white space as a syntactical character. The last language to use syntactical white space was Fortran which was created by IBM in 1957.\n",
    "\n",
    "Languages such as Perl and C ignore white space and rely on other special characters that often mean different things in different contexts. This allowed the programmer to develop their own style independent of the format of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick example is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "foreach my $a (@list_of_numbers){\n",
    "    print \"value of a: $a\\n\";\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact same Perl code could be written like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "foreach my $a (@list_of_numbers){ print \"value of a: $a\\n\"; }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because one of the characters that Perl uses to group instructions are \"{}\" (brackets).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python avoids this type of problem by requiring white space syntax to group sequences of instruction:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for a in list_of_numbers:\n",
    "    print( \"Value of a: \" + str(a))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "## Conditional Statements\n",
    "At the heart of every `if` statement is an expression that can be evaluated as `True` or `False` and is called a _conditional test_. Python uses the values `True` and `False` to decide whether the code in an `if` statement should be executed. If a conditional test evaluates to `True`, Python executes the code following the `if` statement. If the test evaluates to `False`, Python ignores the code following the `if` statement."

    "Create a program that will allow you to quiz small children on their multiplication tables where the numbers can be from 0-12. This program should ask 5 multiplication questions from the user and keep track of the number right and the number wrong. At the end of the five questions tell the user the overall score. You may use the same `random.randint` function that was introduced in 'Practice Problem 2' to make your script more interesting.\n",

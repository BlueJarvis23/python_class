    "IPython is a custom Python shell (`ipython`, from the command line) that includes rich features like tab-completion, inline documentation, all in the same REPL (Read; Evaluate; Print; Loop) format that the normal `python` shell has. It's configurable, customizable, and overall, the best environment for interactive Python work.\n",

The notebook is cell-oriented, meaning we execute codes in chunks, and we can go back and re-execute code selectively as needed. This setup provides a great way to work on data - load it in once, and then work on your data iteratively, without re-loading or re-extracting.\n",

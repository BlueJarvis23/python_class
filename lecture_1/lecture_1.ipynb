    "Syntax in the context of computer code is the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be a correctly structured document or fragment in that language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was designed to have a very clean look to the code. The compromise is that to correctly interpret the code python elected to use whitespace as a syntactical character. The last language to use syntactical whitespace was Fortran which was created by IBM in 1957.\n",
    "\n",
    "Languages such as Perl and C ignore whitespace and rely on other special characters that often mean different things in different contexts. This allowed the programmer to develop their own style independent of the format of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick example is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "foreach my $a (@list_of_numbers){\n",
    "    print \"value of a: $a\\n\";\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact same Perl code could be written like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "foreach my $a (@list_of_numbers){ print \"value of a: $a\\n\"; }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because one of the characters that Perl uses to group instructions are \"{}\" (brackets).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python avoids this type of problem by requiring whitespace syntax to group sequences of instruction:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for a in list_of_numbers:\n",
    "    print( \"Value of a: \" + str(a))\n",
